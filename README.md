# Non-invasive-glucometer
Introducing a new method of blood glucose monitoring, the initiative 
provides diabetics with a painless, non-invasive technique to check their blood glucose levels. The device 
detects levels of glucose in the blood without the usage of conventional pinpricks through the integration 
of advanced sensor technology with methods for signal processing. This project uses visual measurements 
with almost asymptomatic measurements to overcome invasive method networks such as frequent failures, 
high repetitive consumption costs, and risk of spreading infections. To detect blood glucose levels, the 
gadget is made up of near-infrared LEDs with wavelengths between 700 and 1400 nm that are optically 
placed at the fingers.  The amount of glucose in the blood determines the amount of light is received. The 
signal is then augmented and introduced as an entrance to the Arduino UNO microcontroller. The 
development and testing of a small, non-invasive blood glucose measuring framework has been 
accomplished.
