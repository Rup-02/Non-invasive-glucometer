# Non-invasive-glucometer
A new method of blood glucose monitoring has been introduced, offering a painless and non-invasive technique for diabetics.

The device eliminates the need for conventional pinpricks by integrating:

Advanced sensor technology

Signal processing methods

It utilizes visual measurements to address drawbacks of invasive methods such as:

Frequent failures

High recurring costs

Risk of spreading infections

The device uses near-infrared (NIR) LEDs with wavelengths ranging from 700 to 1400 nm, optically aligned at the fingers.

The amount of received light corresponds to the blood glucose concentration.

The signal is then:

Amplified

Sent to an Arduino UNO microcontroller for processing

A compact, non-invasive blood glucose measurement system has been successfully developed and tested.
